# Covid-19 Analysis
This project features an interactive Tableau dashboard that provides an in-depth analysis of COVID-19 data, focusing on key metrics such as gender-wise trends, day-wise fluctuations, age group insights, and geographic distribution (excluding Indian data). Through dynamic visualizations, users can explore how different genders and age groups were impacted, analyze daily trends, and understand the global spread of the virus. The dashboard leverages Tableau's powerful filtering and drill-down capabilities to transform raw data into easily interpretable insights, offering a comprehensive view of the pandemicâ€™s effects across different regions and demographics.
